## About

Everyone has their own personal reading history, and as we grow up, we are able to comprehend more and more complicated
texts. But how do you estimate the level of difficulty of a given text, and how do you teach a computer to do that? In
this project, you will find it out: write a program that determines how difficult the text is and for which age it is
most suitable.

## What you'll learn

Once you choose a project, we'll provide you with a study plan that includes all the necessary topics from your course
to get it built. Hereâ€™s what awaits you:

- Stage 1/6: Simplest estimation
    - Input a phrase or a sentence for the program to determine its difficulty level based on the symbol count.
    - Stage Topics:
        - Introduction to Java
        - Basic literals: numbers, strings and characters
        - Writing first program
        - Printing data
        - Types and variables
        - Comments
        - Reading user's input with Scanner
        - Coding style conventions
        - Naming variables
        - Arithmetic operations
        - Integer types and operations
        - Increment and decrement
        - Floating-point types
        - Boolean type and operations. True and false
        - Comparing values. Relational operators
        - Conditional statement
        - One-line condition with ternary operator
        - For loop
        - While and do-while loops
        - Break and continue. Branching
        - Declaring methods
        - Primitive and reference types
        - Type casting
        - Calling methods
        - Primitive and reference types
        - Array
        - Characters
        - String
        - Write, compile, and run
        - Basic terms: JVM, JRE, JDK
        - Operating systems
        - Command line overview
        - Parameters and options
        - Compile and run Java from CLI

        - Debugging overview
        - IntelliJ IDEA
        - Run and debug with IntelliJ IDEA
        - IntelliJ IDEA run configurations
- Stage 2/6: Words and sentences
    - Apply your knowledge of advanced strings, arrays and regular expressions: determine how difficult the text is
      judging by the average count of words in the sentences.
    - Stage Topics:
        - Method "main"
        - Multiple conditions: switch
        - Functional decomposition
        - Arrays as parameters
        - Iterating over arrays
        - What is object-oriented programming

        - Instance methods
        - Initializing new instances. Constructor
        - Processing strings
        - Regular expression
        - Regexps in Java
        - Regex sets, ranges, alternations
        - Regex quantifiers
        - Regex shorthands
        - Debugging simple constructs
        - IntelliJ IDEA basics
        - JetBrains Academy plugin
- Stage 3/6: Score!
    - Add a readability score based on a special formula: it will estimate the difficulty levels of larger bodies of
      texts uploaded from a file.
    - Stage Topics:
        - Overloading
        - Constants. Final variables
        - Errors in programs

        - Reading files
        - Command-line arguments
        - Introduction to logging
        - Debugging techniques
        - Debugging methods
- Stage 4/6: More parameters
    - More parameters can be taken into account: for example, you can consider syllables and letters. Enable the program
      to base its estimation on those parameters altogether.
    - Stage Topics:
        - Math library
