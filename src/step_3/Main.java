/**
 * Score!
 * ------
 * Description
 * In this stage, you will program the Automated readability index (ARI). It was introduced in 1968 and a lot of
 * research works rely on this.
 * This article on ARI (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_readability_index) can give you more specifics on the
 * application and age brackets.
 * Also, your program should read a file instead of typing a text manually. You should pass the filename through the
 * command line arguments.
 * The program should output the score itself and an approximate age needed to comprehend the text.
 * Use the appropriate rounding function to calculate the score as integer.
 * You should also print how many characters, words, and sentences the text has.
 * The number of characters is any visible symbol (so, in the real text it's everything except space, newline "\n" and
 * tab "\t").
 * Notice, that the text can contain multiple lines, not just a single line like in the previous stages. You should
 * analyze all the lines.
